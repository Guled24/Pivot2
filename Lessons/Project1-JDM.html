<p>My favourite JDM Car are R34 and  Supra</p>

<p>R34 is  Nissan GTR Skyline and has many different specs. It was released from 1998 to 2002.  It is one of the most known and famous JDM cars and is known from the fast and furious as Paul Walker drove it in the ‘2 Fast 2 Furious’ movie.</p>

<p>As said above tv shows and gangs helped grow JDM culture. Two examples are the Midnigth Club and Intial D(anime).</p>

<p id="midnight">Mid night Club was an infamous street racing club and had an influence growing the JDM Car scene as they raced and drifted up and down mountains and where operating from 1987 to 1999.<br> The groups disbanded in 1999 and members dont talk about the activities they has done and the cars they used were destroyed or went missing. One of the most iconic cars was ‘The Yoshida Special 930s’ which was a Porsche.</p>

<p id="initial">Initial D is a Japanese street racing manga series written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno. It was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine from 1995 to 2013 and grew the JDM Car culture across the world as many people <br>around the world match anime.</p>
