<h3>Ramen</h3>
<p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style alkaline wheat noodles served in a meat-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes.</p>
<p>Two types of noodles I wanna try are miso ramen and soba.<br><br> Miso ramen has a rich, silky mouthfeel with the classic tangy saltiness of fermented soybeans. Because it's a paste, miso also thickens the broth slightly, making it a bit more filling.<br><br> Soba noodles are around the same thickness as ramen noodles, but the two are very different. Soba is made from buckwheat flour which gives it a distinctive brown colour, and has a much softer, less elastic texture. They are excellent at soaking up broth, flavouring every<br> millimetre of the soba noodle.

<h3>Samurai's</h3>
<p>Samurai were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in 1876. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo. They had high prestige and special privileges such as wearing two swords<br> and Kiri-sute gomen. Samurais are cool in general and they have a strict code they follow and use samurai swords and wear amazing armour.</p>
