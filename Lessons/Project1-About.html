<h2>Awards and Achievements</h2>
<p>In life I believe you should remember and relish on your personal achievements and awards.<br>You should milk the success and bragging rights that come with and some of my awards and achievments are: </p>
<ol>
	<li>One of my biggest achievements is that I achieved DDD (which is equivalent to three a’s).</li>
    <li>Lamba pass-This is something small but something I like to hold against my sister cus she didnt pass lol. It is basically where you pick a book and read it with emotion and express the words in some next vocal and physical.<br> It was weird but a success because of the bragging rights.</li>
    <li>I am married and have been married nearly for a year and got married when I was 19</li>
</ol>
